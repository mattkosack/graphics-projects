# Heroku
~~Wanted to try hosting on another platform, so some of the code is for the setup on Heroku.~~

Heroku is no longer free.

# Render

~~Until I feel like setting up my own server, or have enough projects that warrant paying for one, I will continue to find free sites to host.~~

# Github Pages

Github is awesome. I have premium so I have lots of freedom here.
